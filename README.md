# Connect-Four

  Hi, this is my final project in C Programming course in NSYSU in Spring, 2016.
  Because Google Alphago just became the new world champion,
  so my partner and I decided to writed a simple classic game : Connect Four,
  and build an AI in order to to defeat human!
  
  We are pleasure to improve our program and add more interesting functions!
  Commit and Pull to let us know:)
